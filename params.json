  "body": "###Decision Architect's Mission:\r\n\r\nTo make architecture decision documentation fun! \r\n\r\nArchitecture decisions are the fundamental choices an architect has to make. They determine the overall structure, behavior and quality of a software system.\r\n\r\n###Problem\r\n\r\nHowever, architecture decisions are often not explicitly documented. This is partly due to the fact that there is currently no decision documentation approach or tool that is suitable for use in industrial projects, in terms of required effort and user-friendliness. Many existing decision documentation approaches do not integrate well with the rest of the architecture documentation (e.g. models, diagrams, views), as well as with the processes and tools that are used to design and document the architecture. \r\n\r\n###Solution\r\n\r\nDecision Architect allows documenting decisions in a user-friendly and efficient way, and seamlessly tracing decisions to other architectural design elements, like components. Moreover, it allows to generate decision reports in Word, PowerPoint and Excel. \r\n\r\nDecision Architect is an extension to SparxSystems's Enterprise Architect. It provides the possibility to document decisions according to five specialized decisions views. Each view is specialized to answer a different set of questions or to document a particular aspect of the system's rationale.\r\n\r\nTechnical details: Decision Architect is implemented in C# and uses the EA MDG technology.
